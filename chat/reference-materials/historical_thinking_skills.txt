HISTORICAL THINKING SKILLS – CONSTRAINED QUESTION SCHEMAS

⸻

1. Comprehension

Goal: Student understands what the source literally says. Only literal, text-based questions are allowed.

Allowed Question Forms (Pick One per Turn):
	1.	Action Identification – “According to the source, what did [person] do?”
	2.	Method/Process Identification – “What method or approach is described in this excerpt?”
	3.	Outcome/Result Identification – “What happened as a result, according to the text?”
	4.	Detail/Fact Identification – “What number, date, or named detail is mentioned here?”
	5.	Literal Paraphrase – “Can you summarize this paragraph in your own words?”

Forbidden Question Forms:
	•	Cause-effect / “why” questions
	•	Questions about impact, significance, or consequences
	•	Questions about author perspective (Sourcing)
	•	Inference beyond the literal text
	•	Deciding when the skill is complete

Optional Fact Injection:
	•	1–2 historical context facts pre-selected for Comprehension
	•	No explanation, interpretation, or commentary

AI Behavior:
	•	Pick exactly one allowed question per student response
	•	Do not summarize, explain, or decide mastery

⸻

2. Contextualization

Goal: Place the source in its historical moment.

	1.	Ask about time period – “When was this written?” (publication context)
	2.	Ask about location or setting – “Where did these events take place?” (subject/event context)
	3.	Ask about observable historical conditions – “What was happening in society at this time?” (subject/event context)
	4.	Ask about relevant historical events or norms – “What major events or norms were present during this period?” (subject/event context)

Note: Both "publication context" (when/where/who created the source) and "subject/event context" (historical background of the event/topic) are valid. AI may use either type as appropriate.


Forbidden Question Forms:
	•	Author motives or perspective
	•	Cause-effect / consequences of the source
	•	Inference about why the source exists

Optional Fact Injection:
	•	1–2 brief historical context points (e.g., era overview)

AI Behavior:
	•	Pick one question per turn
	•	Keep questions strictly about time, place, and conditions (either publication context or subject/event context)

⸻

3. Sourcing

Goal: Analyze who created the source and how that shapes it.

Allowed Question Forms:
	1.	Ask about author identity or role – “Who wrote this? What was their position?”
	2.	Ask about audience – “Who was this written for?”
	3.	Ask about purpose – “Why might the author have created this?”
	4.	Ask about perspective influence – “Given the author’s position, what might they emphasize or downplay?”

Forbidden Question Forms:
	•	Judging reliability or trustworthiness
	•	Evaluating usefulness for answering the guiding question
	•	Cause-effect or significance analysis

Fact Injection:
	•	AI must inject predefined background facts about the author (such as occupation, social status, or known affiliations) without waiting for the student to supply them.
AI Behavior:
	•	One question per turn
	•	Focus only on author, audience, purpose, perspective

⸻

4. Claim / Evidence

Goal: Answer the guiding question using the source. (NOT about author's claim.)

Allowed Question Forms:
	1.	Ask the student to make a claim – “Based on this source, what can you argue about [guiding question]?” (The claim should address the guiding question, not restate the author's claim.)
	2.	Ask for textual evidence – “Which words or phrases support your claim?”
	3.	Ask for connection between evidence and claim – “How does that evidence support your argument?”

Forbidden Question Forms:
	•	Asking about author perspective (Sourcing)
	•	Evaluating usefulness or reliability (Evaluation)
	•	Asking why these events occurred outside the text

Optional Fact Injection:
	•	Relevant contextual facts if strictly needed for comprehension

AI Behavior:
	•	Pick one allowed question per turn
	•	Always require direct connection to the source

⸻

5. Evaluation

Goal: Assess the usefulness and limitations of the source for answering the guiding question.

Allowed Question Forms:
	1.	Ask about strengths – “What does this source tell us clearly?”
	2.	Ask about limitations – “What does this source not show us?”
	3.	Ask about bias effects on content – “How might the author’s perspective limit the information?”

Forbidden Question Forms:
	•	Simple reliable/unreliable judgments
	•	General cause-effect or significance analysis
	•	Asking for claims not grounded in evidence

Optional Fact Injection:
	•	Brief historical context for perspective if needed

AI Behavior:
	•	Pick one allowed question per turn
	•	Focus strictly on source content relative to the guiding question
